# Workshop Building modern web applications using .NET Core and Angular
Welcome to the workshop "Building modern web applications using .NET Core and Angular". 

In this workshop you will create a .NET Core application with a Single Page Application frontend in Angular and learn how to create and design a solution for modern web applications running in a Docker ecosystem.

To get the best experience with the hands-on-labs it is recommended that you prepare the following:
- Laptop for development and running containers
- Azure subscription to create and use a Docker container cluster

### Preparing for workshop

Even though you can certainly participate in this workshop with an unprepared laptop, it will save a lot of time to install your development machine ahead of time. In [Lab 1 - Getting started](docs/Lab1-GettingStarted.md) you will find a list of the recommended tools to install on your laptop or development Virtual Machine.

Additionally, for hosting a container cluster in Microsoft Azure you will need an Azure subscription. You can [create a trial account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) if you do not have a subscription available.
